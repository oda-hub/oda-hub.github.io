      <description>Workflow Publishing and Discovery with KG: Old-School Astronomer Guide Purpose of this note Technologies develop rapidly, and not all astronomers can keep up. More importantanly, it is smart of them not to chase the latest fashion, since it may take a lot of effort with little benefit. Furthermore, common, reusable developments compete with specialized fit-for-purpose ad-hoc work.

      <description>Details about the reasoning engines Workflows entities in the KG can undergo various transformations. One key transformation is currying, understood in the same way as function currying - since workflow, for our purposes, is very similar to a function. Currying transforms workflow with parameters with workflow with less parameters (arguments), possibly without any parameters. We assume that only workflow without parameters can be computed (executed).
